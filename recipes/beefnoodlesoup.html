        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with roughly 6 quarts of water and add the beef shank, 3 green onions, 5 slices of ginger, and 3 star anise pods.
                Cover, bring to boil over high heat, and cook for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the meat from the pot, rinse in cold water, and cut into thick slices. Discard the cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>In a wok or a large pan over medium-high heat, pour in the vegetable oil and add the remaining 3 green onions, 3 ginger slices, garlic,
                red chiles, 3 star anise pods, onion, rock sugar, and spicy bean paste. Cook until the onions start to become translucent.
            </li>
            <li>Add the sliced beef.</li>
            <li>Add the dark soy sauce (for color) stir, and then add the rice wine.</li>
            <li>Pour in the light soy sauce (for flavor), then add the tomatoes. Stir fry for 8 - 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill the same large pot about a quarter of the way with water and heat over medium-high heat. Add the stir-fried meat, vegetables, 
                and cooking liquid.
            </li>
            <li>Add more water until the meat is just covered, then add the white pepper, salt, and bay leaves. Cover and reduce the heat to low and simmer
                for at least 2 hours, until the meat becomes tender. Remove the bay leaves and star anise before serving. 
            </li>
            <li>Add the bok choy to the boiling water. Cook for 3 minutes and remove.</li>
            <li>To assemble the soup, place a generous amount of noodles in the bottom of a bowl. Then, add bok choy, meat, and broth. Garnish with 
                green onions, cilantro, and red chiles.
